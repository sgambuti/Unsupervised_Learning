# Unsupervised_Learning
This notebook demonstrates unsupervised machine learning algorithms using two datasets: a diabetes dataset from North Carolina State University and a dataset containing courses in the Data Science Masters Program at Syracuse University. 
The goal of this notebook is to practice building PySpark Pipelines and provide appropriate recommendations based upon the results from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF),
and K-means Clustering. 

The notes provided in this notebook were written by Daniel Acuna, my Big Data Analysis Professor at Syracuse University in 2021.
